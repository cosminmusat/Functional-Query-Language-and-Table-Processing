# Functional Query Language and Table Processing in Scala

Features:
- Implemented a functional table-processing engine with CSV parsing, value selection by columns, recursive filtering, column addition and table merging.
- Developed a recursive Query Language (Select, Filter, NewCol, Merge) enabling flexible combination of table-processing functions.
- Designed the system to separate operation logic from implementation, facilitating easy extension, debugging, and testing of new functionalities.
